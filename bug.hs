This Haskell code suffers from a common issue related to laziness and infinite loops.  The function `infiniteList` generates an infinite list, and the `take 5` function attempts to take the first 5 elements. However, because Haskell is lazy, the `infiniteList` is only evaluated when its elements are actually needed.  The problem arises when we try to print the result; the program tries to print all the elements of the infinite list that `take 5` returns which would never end. This results in the program hanging or running indefinitely. 

```haskell
infiniteList :: [Integer]
infiniteList = [1..] 

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = take 5 infiniteList
  print result
```
